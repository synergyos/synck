# Synck 0.2 repository format

Status: implementation in progress. Only the sections below are specified;
this document is not yet the complete release specification.

## Portable names

An item name is nonempty NFC-normalized UTF-8, at most 255 bytes. It is not
`.` or `..`, contains none of `< > : " / \ | ? *`, U+0000–U+001F or U+007F,
and does not end in ASCII space or dot. Unicode format characters, including
emoji joiners, are allowed.

Windows device stems are forbidden, case-insensitively, including when followed
by an extension: CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, CONIN$, CONOUT$, COM1–COM9 and LPT1–LPT9.
COM and LPT followed by superscript ¹, ² or ³ are also forbidden. Spaces at the
end of the stem before its first dot do not escape the restriction.

Sibling uniqueness uses Unicode 17.0.0 default full case folding of the NFC
name, using CaseFolding.txt entries C and F, never locale-sensitive/Turkic
folding. Preserve the display spelling. A case-only rename is allowed when it
does not conflict with another item. Normalization uses the pinned
unicode-normalization 0.1.26 tables. The name vectors are language-neutral
JSON in `vectors/names.json`.

A proposed portable spelling normalizes NFC, replaces each forbidden character
with `_`, strips trailing ASCII spaces/dots, substitutes `_` for an empty result,
prefixes device names with `_`, and truncates on a UTF-8 boundary to 255 bytes.
Strip any space or dot exposed by truncation. For sibling collisions append
` (2)`, ` (3)`, etc., reserving suffix bytes before truncation. Filesystem
renaming requires explicit `--fix-names`; validation alone never renames files.
Non-UTF-8 names are errors, never guessed encodings.
